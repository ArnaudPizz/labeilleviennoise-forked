- [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/) is used for each commit to check if the commit message meet the
  conventional commit format ([Commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint)) and run tests,
  linters and types checking (see `.husky/` directory for more details).

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside this project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
